Ladder Diagram, or LD, is the most commonly used PLC programming language. 
It is a high-level, graphical programming language that is designed to be 
easy to read and understand for easy maintenance and troubleshooting.
Using this software we can simulate the embedded system created using PLC
microcontroller.
here I have done simulation of -
